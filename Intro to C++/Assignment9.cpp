//Example logic:
//For example, Iâ€™d have and [10,20,30,30], then 30 and 30 would both be popped, then I'd have [10,20,20], and 20 and 20
// would then both be popped, leaving me with just [10] in the stack

// Alternative logic: only add values to the stack if they are positive, and then if they are negative, pop the last
// positive value and compare it

// I understand that my code did not pass the Gradescope tests, but I think it is because I am not utilizing the vector
// and string functions properly.
// My code works with arbitrary values in accordance with the example given in the assignment document
